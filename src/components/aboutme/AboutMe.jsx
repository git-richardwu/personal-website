                            first-generation Asian American and I currently reside in the ever-bustling New York City. Growing up, I have always had 
                            an eye for design given my interest in pursuing an art career. While those ambitions have now become more of a pastime,
                            I now strive to channel that creativity into developing software and applications.
                            My hobbies include listening to music, cooking, and developing video games.
