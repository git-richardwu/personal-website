                        <div className="cardDescription">
                        I am a college graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, specializing in front-end development within team projects. 
                        My experience extends to full-stack development, particularly with MERN stack, I have a strong passion for UI/UX design and actively prototype interfaces for every project I am involved in. 
                        Proficient in the Agile methodology, I thrive in collaborative work environments and am always eager to learn new technologies. 
                        With a portfolio encompassing personal projects such as a dynamic hue sorting gallery and a browser typing game, I am now seeking a role in software engineering where I can continue to expand my skills, 
                        contribute to innovative projects, and fuel my continuous growth as a developer.
